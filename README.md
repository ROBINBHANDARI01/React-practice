# React Practice Apps

This repository contains small React applications built while learning React.
These are practice projects and may be improved or refactored as I continue learning React.

Each app focuses on practicing specific React concepts such as:
- useState
- props
- component structure
- event handling
- conditional rendering

All projects are created using **Vite + React** and are meant for learning and experimentation.

## How to run a project
Each folder is an independent React app.

```bash
cd project-folder-name
npm install
npm run dev
